# image_classification
This repository compiles the scripts I used in my master thesis about wall lizard image identification using CNNs.
I focused on a two-class and on a nine-class problem, and the scripts included here address these two problems separately.

The image data used for this work can be found in https://www.dropbox.com/s/0omtu36cpune9ed/IMAGE_DATA.zip?dl=0
Use at will but please acknowledge Kaliontzopoulou et al. 2012 and Caeiro-Dias (2018) as the sources of the data and my thesis as the source of the preprocessing:
